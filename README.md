## Inspiration

A huge portion of corporate code is written in programming languages/frameworks from the digital Stone Age. In order for them to recruit developers with today's skills, be secure, and follow the trends migration to more modern technologies is of high importance.

## What it does

Our solutions is simple like eating a cake. All you have to do is give it a github repository and what it does is:
- outputs a pseudo-code with the structure of the repo
- give the user the ability to interact with it and make code changes without changing a single line
- convert the pseudocode to the programming language/framework of interest (using ready solutions like Pythagoras or manually)
