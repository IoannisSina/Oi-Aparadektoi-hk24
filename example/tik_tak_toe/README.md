# Tik Tak Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in Python. It allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to mark a space in the grid with their symbol ('X' or 'O'). The game checks for a winner after every move and ends when one player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.

## Overview

The project uses Python for its implementation, relying on basic data structures like arrays for the game board. It consists of a single script (`tik_tak_toe.py`) that includes functions for initializing the board, displaying the board, making moves, and checking for a winner or a draw.

## Features

- **Game Initialization**: Sets up the game board with empty spaces.
- **Display Board**: Visual representation of the current state of the game board.
- **Player Moves**: Allows the players to enter their moves.
- **Winning Condition Check**: Checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
